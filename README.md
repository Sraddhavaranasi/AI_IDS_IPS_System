# AI-Powered Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS)

This is a full-stack AI-powered IDS/IPS solution built for **Vijaya Enterprises**, a telecom and IT solutions provider. The system detects and prevents cybersecurity threats in real time using machine learning models, email alerts, a web dashboard, and IP blocking using Windows Firewall.

## üöÄ Project Structure

- `backend/` ‚Äì FastAPI-based backend that loads AI models, detects threats, blocks malicious IPs, and logs activities.
- `frontend/` ‚Äì React-based dashboard with login, detection input form, threat results, and sign-out.
- `datasets/` ‚Äì Contains training datasets and the final cleaned merged dataset used for model training and testing.
- `notebooks/` ‚Äì Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## üìä Datasets Used

1. **Company-Specific Logs**  
   - Real anonymized logs from Vijaya Enterprises network operations.
   - Contains features such as IP addresses, protocol, ports, byte flows, etc.

2. **NSL-KDD Dataset**  
   - Improved version of the classic KDD Cup 1999 dataset.
   - Used for evaluating and training ML models for network intrusion detection.

3. **CIC-IDS 2017 Dataset**  
   - Industry-grade intrusion detection dataset.
   - Includes a wide range of modern attacks like brute force, DoS, botnet, etc.

4. **FINAL_MERGED_DATASET_CLEAN.csv**  
   - The final dataset generated by preprocessing and combining the above sources.
   - Only this file is included in the GitHub repo to reduce size.

## ü§ñ AI Models Used

- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Isolation Forest**

Both models are trained using extracted features to detect normal and anomalous traffic. Once a threat is detected, the source IP can be automatically blocked using Windows Firewall commands.

## üì¶ Features

- Threat Detection using trained AI models
- Automatic IP Blocking using Windows Firewall
- Email Alerts via Mailtrap
- Real-time logging in MongoDB
- Interactive web dashboard for secure access

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python, scikit-learn, joblib, pymongo
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Email**: Mailtrap
- **OS-Level Prevention**: Windows Firewall for IP blocking
- **Deployment Tools** *(coming next)*: Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Jenkins CI/CD
